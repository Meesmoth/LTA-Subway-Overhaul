# LTA Subway Overhaul
A lore-friendly overhaul of Liberty City's subway system to faithfully resemble its real-life counterpart.

The goal of the mod is to provide a more immersive subway experience without breaking the game lore.

**Created and released in celebration for the [120th anniversary](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/traffic_and_transit/2024/10/26/new-york-city-subway-celebrates-120th-anniversary) of the subway system.**
